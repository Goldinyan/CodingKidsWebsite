# Coding Kids Admin Portal

This project powers the administrative backend of [Coding Kids Niederrhein](https://codingkids-niederrhein.de), a regional initiative offering programming workshops for children. The platform enables organizers to manage events, handle participant registrations, track attendance, and export relevant data.

Built with a focus on clarity and control, the system includes role-based access, dynamic filtering, and secure data handling. It streamlines the logistics behind Coding Kids — from planning sessions to communicating with parents — and is designed to scale with growing demand.

This repository contains the core logic, UI components, and backend integrations needed to operate the admin interface efficiently.
